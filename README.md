# Seven Bridges of Konigsberg
The Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg is a historically notable problem in mathematics. Its negative resolution by Leonhard Euler in 1736 laid the foundations of graph theory and prefigured the idea of topology. This program calculates all possible paths over bridges (even though there is none).
